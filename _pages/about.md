The Department of Glaciology and Climate at GEUS (Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland are responsible for the monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This includes the operation of a network of weather stations under the [PROMICE](https://promice.dk/) (Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet) and [GC-Net](http://cires1.colorado.edu/steffen/gcnet/) (Greenland Climate Network) monitoring programmes, and several operational data products including Greenland-wide total mass balance and ice velocity mapping. All of our data products are freely available through the [GEUS Dataverse](https://dataverse.geus.dk/).

This space serves as place for us to document our products and their set-ups, and write walkthrough guides for common operations across our department.
